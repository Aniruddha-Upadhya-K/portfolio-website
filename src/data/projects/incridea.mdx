## Background

Incridea is a National level techno-cultural fest, hosted by NMAM Institute of Technology (that's the college I studied in). There's been a legacy of making cool frontend for the event for quite a few years, which was continued post covid. By 2023, even the judging process and almost the entire backend of the event were fully migrated to the website, making the whole event paperless.. Looking those cool UI's, I was inspired to join the tech team behind it. And sure enough, I became a part of the team in 2024. This write-up is all about that year's site.

Our ambitions? Huge. We wanted to take things to the next level—make the site 3D, add a narrative, and basically turn the website into an experience. The theme for the year was Dice of Destiny, and true to the name, we planned to include some mini-games scattered across the site. To add more spices to already complicated expectations, we barely had 15 days of time from the first design sketches to the final live release. Backend was almost ready, same as previous years, but with some much-needed bug fixes and improvements. But frontend? almsot everything is new, soo new that nobody among us have worked in 3D earlier. Sure I did give it a try once or twice, but never crossed the point of adding bunch of `Sphere`s and `Cube`s to the scene. And then there was my senior, **Swasthk Shetty**, who pitched the idea of 3D and with idea of how it works, sort of. 

So yeah, the challenge was real: design wireframes, search for 3D assets, come up with animations, throw in a story, maybe even sneak in a mini-game or two - all while staying true to the theme. It was hectic, chaotic, and honestly overwhelming at times-but also incredibly fun and rewarding in its own way.

And somehow, we pulled it off. No, it didn’t make into the top "coolest websites of the year" list, but it absolutely exceeded our own expectations. And considering the tight deadlines and the amount of learning involved, that’s a sure win as far as I'm concerned. And here is a glimpse of that...
